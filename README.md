# Tick Tack Toe

This is a basic Tick Tack Toe project to improve my coding skills.  
You can play PvP and in the future there will be a Player vs. Bot.

## Installation

You need a Webserver like xampp and a browser.  
Just clone this project and start playing.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Vashtaneradan/TickTackToe.git
```
